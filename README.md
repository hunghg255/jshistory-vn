## Original introduction
This book is jointly written by Brendan Eich, the father of JavaScript, and Allen Wirfs-Brock, the lead author of the ES6 specification. It records and explains in detail the evolution of the JavaScript language over a total of 20 years from the birth of the language in 1995 to the formulation of the ES6 specification in 2015. The book not only explains the evolution of a large number of language technical details, but also reviews the historical successes and failures in specification formulation and standard games at a higher level. It is a story about how humans promote industrial development through competition and cooperation in business and technology. .

The story is quite long and complicated. The full text is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a major stage in the evolution of JavaScript. There is also a brief interlude between each section to introduce how developers at that time viewed and used JavaScript.

These four parts are as follows:

1. **[The Birth of the Language](./part-1.md)** (The Origins of JavaScript), introduces the creation and early development of JavaScript, including the language’s birth background, naming method, initial features and its design philosophy wait. This section also traces its initial evolution at Netscape and other companies, such as Microsoft's JScript.
2. **[Creating a Standard](./part-2.md)** (Creating a Standard) introduces the process from JavaScript to ECMAScript standard. This mainly covers the initiation of JavaScript standardization work, the creation of specifications, relevant contributors, and decision-making methods.
3. **[Failed Reformations](./part-3.md)** (Failed Reformations), which introduces the failed attempts of the ECMAScript committee to modify the language after Eich left, lacking a "benevolent dictator". This mainly involves committee splits, two rounds of investment in ES4, and the origins of Flash and ActionScript in it.
4. **[Carry on the past and open up the future](./part-4.md)** (Modernizing JavaScript), introduces the story behind the two successful standards of ES5 in 2009 and ES6 in 2015, mainly including the goals of ES5 and ES6, An introduction and review of major fundamental changes and important new features.
