### JavaScript Release Announcement December 4, 1995

[[Netscape and Sun 1995](./references.md#netscape:press:javascript), Page 1-2]

**Netscape and Sun Microsystems Announce JavaScript: An Open Cross-Platform Object Scripting Language for Enterprise Networks and the Internet**

28 industry-leading companies support JavaScript as a complement to Java for convenient online application development

---

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) - Netscape Communications (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ: SUNW) today announced the availability of JavaScript. It is an open, cross-platform object scripting language that can be used to create and customize applications on enterprise networks and the Internet. The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun's industry-leading cross-platform object-oriented programming language. The initial version of JavaScript is now available as part of the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta and can be downloaded from Netscape's website now.

In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including AOL, Apple Computer, Architext Software, Attachmate, AT&T, Borland International, Brio Technologies, CA Technologies, DEC, Hewlett-Packard, Iconovex, Illustra Information Technology Corporation, Informix Software Corporation, Intuit Corporation, Macromedia Corporation, Metrowerks Corporation, Novell Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Paper Software Corporation, Precept Software Corporation, RAD Technologies, Santa Cruz Operations and Silicon Valley Graphics Corporation, Spider Technologies, Sybase Corporation , Toshiba Corporation, Verity Corporation and Vermeer Technologies, among others, support JavaScript as an open-standard object scripting language and plan to provide it in future products. A draft specification for JavaScript, as well as a final draft specification for Java, are scheduled to be published this month and submitted to relevant standards bodies for industry review and comment.

JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language. It is designed to create real-time online applications that connect objects and resources on clients and servers. While Java has been used by programmers to create new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for HTML page authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically modify the behavior of objects running on the client or server. of scripting. JavaScript is similar to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little (or even no) programming experience to quickly build complex applications. JavaScript is designed to represent the next generation of software designed specifically for the Internet. It has the following characteristics:

* Designed for creating web-centric applications
* Can complement and integrate with Java
* Can complement and integrate with HTML
* Open and cross-platform

Developed by Sun Microsystems, Java is an object-oriented programming language that runs independently of any operating system or microprocessor. Java programs called applets can be transferred over the network and run on any client, providing CD-ROM-like multimedia capabilities on corporate networks and the Internet. Java has become widely popular among programmers because it eliminates the need to port applications. It also has the potential to reduce the cost of distributing and maintaining applications on the network, so it has also been widely welcomed by information system managers.

With JavaScript, it is possible to add smart forms to HTML pages. It can perform calculations such as loan payments or currency conversions on the client side based on user input. A small multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can also display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a certain area through JavaScript scripts. Server-side JavaScript scripts can pull data from a relational database and format it into HTML on the fly. The page may also contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server. On the server, scripts can dynamically combine and format HTML content based on user preferences stored in a relational database; on the client, scripts can glue together various Java applets and HTML table elements. , forming a real-time interactive user interface for network-wide information search.

Both Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients and servers, where JavaScript scripts can be used to modify the properties and behavior of Java objects. Therefore, the boundaries for real-time online applications that dynamically present information to users and interact with users through corporate networks or the Internet are almost unlimited. Netscape will support Java and JavaScript in client and server products, as well as corresponding programming tools and applications, to realize this vision.

Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun, said: "Programmers are very enthusiastic about Java because it was designed for the Internet from the beginning. JavaScript is a natural match because JavaScript is also designed for the Internet. and is designed for global use based on Unicode. JavaScript will be the most effective means of connecting HTML-based content to Java applets."

Netscape's authoring and application development tools - Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire, and Netscape LiveWire Pro - are designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications. Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to be installed, run, and managed on Netscape servers within the enterprise and on the Internet. Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for JavaScript when connecting to high-performance relational databases from Illustra, Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase. All Netscape products have built-in support for Java and JavaScript, providing a unified, front-to-back "client/server/tool" environment for building and deploying real-time online applications.

Developers can use Java for free. The Java compiler, Java Development Kit, HotJava browser, and related documentation are available from Sun's website [http://java.sun.com](http://java.sun.com). Additionally, Java source code can be licensed for a fee. Detailed information about licensing is also available on the [java.sun.com](http://java.sun.com) web page. To date, Sun has licensed Java to some of the leading technology companies, including Borland, Macromedia, Mitsubishi, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon Valley Graphics, Spyglass, and Toshiba. Sun's Workshop for Java toolbox is scheduled for release in spring 1996. Sun's NEO product line, the first complete development, operations and management environment for object-oriented web applications, will also use a Java-enabled browser as a front-end for the NEO environment.

Netscape and Sun Microsystems plan to propose JavaScript as an open Internet scripting language standard to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). JavaScript will be an open, freely licensed proposed standard that can be used by the entire Internet community. Existing Sun Java licensed users will also be licensed for JavaScript. In addition, Sun Microsystems and Netscape plan to provide a source code reference implementation of JavaScript for buyout licensing to further encourage the adoption of JavaScript as a standard in a variety of products.

Netscape Communications is the premier provider of open software. It connects people and information through corporate networks and the Internet. The company offers a full line of Netscape Navigator clients, Netscape servers, development tools and Netscape Internet applications, creating a complete platform for the next generation of real-time online applications. Netscape Communications is listed on Nasdaq under the stock code "NSCP" and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.

Sun Microsystems, with annual revenues of $6 billion, provides solutions that enable customers to build and maintain open networked computing environments. A recognized advocate of open standards, the company designs, manufactures and sells commercial and technical computing products, technologies and services.
