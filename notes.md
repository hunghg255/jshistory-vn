# Remark

* <a id="4">[4]</a> There is more information on Eich's early career in Coders at Work [[Seibel 2009](./references.md#codersatwork), chapter 4] Detailed description.
* <a id="5">[5]</a> This refers to the Scheme programming language [[Sussman and Steele Jr 1975](./references.md#Sussman75scheme:an)].
* <a id="6">[6]</a> The secret alpha version of Java was released in March or April 1995.
* <a id="7">[7]</a> Jon Bentley [[1986](./references.md#littlelangs)] introduced the term "little language" to refer to those small and easy-to-use languages. language of learning. They focus on solving problems in a specific domain and do not include many features found in traditional languages.
* <a id="8">[8]</a> There is no known exact date of Mocha's birth, but Brendan Eich believes it was between May 6 and 15.
* <a id="9">[9]</a> The earliest Mocha implementations used large * differentiated unions * <sup>[g](./appendices.md#discriminated-union)</sup> To express different data *values*<sup>[g](./appendices.md#value)</sup>, and perform memory management based on reference counting.
* <a id="10">[10]</a> During Brendan Eich's first month at Netscape, he worked on the server team.
* <a id="11">[11]</a> Eich's discussion included John Giannandrea, who worked at General Magic, where he implemented two programming techniques that could be used on both the client and server sides. language.
* <a id="12">[12]</a> The design of `eval` can support some form of partial evaluation of the code, or execute the code provided to the client on the server side, and Telescript [ [General Magic 1995](./references.md#telescript)] Proxies are similar.
* <a id="13">[13]</a> Developers in 1995 wouldn't use the term "sprint," but it describes the nature of the work Eich was doing well.
* <a id="14">[14]</a> A compound statement contains nested statements as part of its grammatical structure. Usually used as a nested statement is a statement block. Most kinds of compound statements have a single nested statement within them. In this case, the nested statement is the "body" of the compound statement.
* <a id="15">[15]</a> The `with` statement was added at the request of the Netscape LiveWire team after the 10-day Mocha sprint.
* <a id="16">[16]</a> The borrowed part includes the syntax of function declaration in AWK, and the semantics of `return` statement.
* <a id="17">[17]</a> "undefined" in this section is in italics because JavaScript 1.0 does not yet provide a name that can directly obtain the value.
* <a id="18">[18]</a> The so-called covering refers to creating a new attribute to override access to the prototype attribute.
* <a id="19">[19]</a> Because JavaScript's object abstraction mechanism lacks formal naming, it is difficult to discuss the specific kinds of objects supported by JavaScript libraries. JavaScript documentation uses a variety of terms, including "types", "objects", "constructors", and "classes" to discuss this abstraction. In the remainder of this article, we use the term "class" to discuss the definition of a set of JavaScript objects that share a common representation and methods, regardless of the specific form of the definition.
* <a id="20">[20]</a> The original HTML `<frame>` tag has been deprecated and replaced by the `<iframe>` tag. But the semantics discussed in this section are the same for both elements.
* <a id="21">[21]</a> As long as no `>` or `--` operators, which are illegal in HTML comments, do not appear in the script body, it is a valid HTML comment.
* <a id="22">[22]</a> Much of the material in this section is based on a recorded interview conducted by Allen Wirfs-Brock on March 22, 2018, with Robert Welland, Shon Katzenberger and Peter Kukol [[Welland et al. 2018](./references.md#jscript:interview)].
* <a id="23">[23]</a> VBA stands for Visual Basic for Application, a variant of Visual Basic 6 embedded in Microsoft Office applications.
* <a id="24">[24]</a> In a 2018 interview, Kukol said that he recently visited Microsoft's JavaScript team and found that his original parser was still (after expansion) being blocked by Microsoft's then Used by JavaScript implementation.
* <a id="25">[25]</a> In the JavaScript community, the term "engine" refers to the implementation of the JavaScript language. A JavaScript engine typically consists of a parser, a virtual machine (or similar runtime support), a garbage collector, a standard library implementation, and other components.
* <a id="26">[26]</a> This is a retrospective account by Brendan Eich. "Technical debt" was not the word he would have used in 1996 to express this type of need to "make up for delays in maintenance."
* <a id="27">[27]</a> SpiderMonkey became the name of the JavaScript subsystem in subsequent Netscape and Mozilla browsers. As of 2020, Mozilla is still using this name, even though the actual implementation technology has changed several times.
* <a id="28">[28]</a> In the documentation of JavaScript 1.2 and the ES3 specification, literal syntax is called "array initializer" and "object initializer". But the term "literal" is more common in the JavaScript programmer community and in articles and books.
* <a id="29">[29]</a> The `__proto__` pseudo-property is similar to the parent slot in Self.
* <a id="30">[30]</a> The term "Internet time" was coined to describe the short development cycles and frequent product releases of Netscape and other early Web technology developers. of.
* <a id="31">[31]</a> During this period, Ecma used an explicit hyphen to spell the word "co√∂rdinating".
* <a id="32">[32]</a> Associate members of Ecma may only participate in one technical committee. Ecma says its highest membership level is Standard membership. Standard members are official voting members of the Ecma GA General Assembly and can participate in all technical committees.
* <a id="33">[33]</a> Welland may have been thinking of the description of PROG features in Appendix B written by McCarthy.
* <a id="34">[34]</a> We were unable to find files for these channels.
* <a id="35">[35]</a> Brendan Eich believes that Netscape never seriously considered allowing Ecma to use the LiveScript name.
* <a id="36">[36]</a> RDScript refers to Rapid Development Scripting Language.
* <a id="37">[37]</a> The serialization scheme in JavaScript 1.3 includes an extensible set of `toSource` methods for serializing a single object into JavaScript source code. There is also a `#` variable used to represent circular references. The global function `uneval` will serialize an object graph starting from the root level of an object. The source string produced by this process can be deserialized using `eval`. Brendan Eich borrowed the `#n=` and `#n#` syntax for `#` variables from Common Lisp [[Steele 1990](./references.md#steele1990common), pages 578-579].
* <a id="38">[38]</a> Mike Shaver said in a personal communication in 2019 that the idea of designing multiple `catch` clauses was his original creation. Later Netscape [[2000](./references.md#netscape:js1.5:guide)] supported multiple `catch` clauses in JavaScript 1.5, which was a non-standard extension to ES3.
* <a id="39">[39]</a> In some working documents [[Horwat 1998](./references.md#980930-horwat:12); [Venter 1998c](./references.md# Venter:980430-label3)], the `if` keyword prefixed with `catch` to guard the expression will be replaced by a colon.
* <a id="40">[40]</a> *FunctionExpression* is a non-terminal character in ECMAScript syntax. By convention, this symbol is in italics.
* <a id="41">[41]</a> Annex B is one of the appendices to the ES3 specification that provides definitions of deprecated features in ECMAScript.
* <a id="42">[42]</a> A linter is a development-time tool that checks source code for questionable coding practices and error-prone constructs.
* <a id="43">[43]</a> Minimization means removing comments and unnecessary whitespace, and performing other source code transformations that maintain semantics to mechanically reduce the download of JavaScript programs volume.
* <a id="44">[44]</a> Eventually it was recognized that using `eval` to process JSON was a security risk that could expose applications to code injection attacks. Modern JavaScript engines use specialized JSON parsers and are therefore not vulnerable to this attack.
* <a id="45">[45]</a> DiNucci [[1999](./references.md#Web20)] was an early adopter of the terms Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.
* <a id="46">[46]</a> Dynamic HTML (DHTML) uses JavaScript to dynamically modify HTML elements in an active web page.
* <a id="47">[47]</a> Firefox is the product of Netscape's Mozilla project, of which Brendan Eich is the chief architect.
* <a id="48">[48]</a> This opinion comes from a personal communication with Douglas Crockford in 2019.
* <a id="49">[49]</a> Function expression that is executed immediately, a substitute for block-level scope. This technique is well known to Scheme programmers and has been widely used by JavaScript programmers since the mid-2000s. Ben Alman [[2010](./references.md#iife)] coined the term IIFE.
* <a id="50">[50]</a> The so-called numerical unit refers to using measurement units such as meters and kilograms to annotate numerical values. This feature makes sense for units like pixels and points in web pages.
* <a id="51">[51]</a> Chris Dollin and Steve Leach continue to develop the Spice language that is no longer based on JavaScript [[Dollin 2002](./references.md#spicelang)], which was later evolved by Leach into the Ginger programming language [[Leach et al. 2018](./references.md#gingerlang)].
* <a id="52">[52]</a> For dynamically added properties, Microsoft calls them "expando properties".

* <a id="54">[54]</a> In a personal communication in 2018, Venter argued that Raggett's proposal had little impact on Horwat's design.
* Version 1.0 of the <a id="55">[55]</a> .NET platform was officially released on February 13, 2002.
* <a id="56">[56]</a> WPF was later renamed Windows Presentation Foundation.
* <a id="57">[57]</a> In the webpage documenting JavaScript 2 [[Horwat 2003c](./references.md#js2:webpage)], there are records from February 1999 to 2003 Specification change log for June.
* <a id="58">[58]</a> The so-called downcast is to check whether a variable value declared with a certain type can be used in a context that requires a more specific subtype variable value.
* <a id="59">[59]</a> NetObjects is a startup company funded by IBM.
* <a id="60">[60]</a> At that time, the processor, memory and communication bandwidth resources of mobile phones were still very limited.

* <a id="63">[63]</a> XUL (XML User interface Language) is a JavaScript framework used by Mozilla to create Firefox browser extensions.
* <a id="64">[64]</a> Hansen has been an Adobe representative since April 2007.
* <a id="65">[65]</a> On December 3, 2005, Adobe completed its acquisition of Macromedia.
* <a id="66">[66]</a> In 2006, Hoare was working on the Rust [[Hoare 2010](./references.md#rust:wiki)] programming language in the form of a personal project Early design.

* <a id="70">[70]</a> DHTML stands for Dynamic HTML.
* <a id="71">[71]</a> Microsoft's platform was originally codenamed WPF/E and was still in pre-release preview. The platform was officially released in April 2007, with the product name "Silverlight".
* <a id="72">[72]</a> Lambda the Ultimate is a popular web blog among programming language researchers and implementers, also known as LtU.
* <a id="73">[73]</a> M0 is the abbreviation of Milestone 0.
* <a id="74">[74]</a> In the object capability language, objects are used as the basis of "capability-based access control systems".
* <a id="75">[75]</a> In the new version of ES4, the `wrap` operator performs dynamic structured type checking on a value. If the type check succeeds, a wrapper object is created that can be used in place of the value. Before the wrapper proxies the operation onto the original value, it revalidates the operations applied on top of it one by one. This way, through the wrapper, it is possible to use objects whose properties can be deleted or modified, even in the context of a static type declaration.
* <a id="76">[76]</a> Due to the lack of written records, people's memories are vague as to whether Adobe was represented by Smith, McAllister, or both.
* <a id="77">[77]</a> In August 2018, one of the authors ran the same benchmark in the browser on an older 2011 iMac using the then-current version of V8. The results were about 20 times faster than Hobbs' 2008 V8 results.
* <a id="78">[78]</a> Only the first `require` for a specific module will perform the complete loading process. The corresponding `exports` value is retained by the loader and returned immediately on subsequent `require` of the same module.
* <a id="79">[79]</a> Web developers should still consider the possibility that browser users may disable JavaScript, or that the page may be loaded into a program without JavaScript support.
* <a id="80">[80]</a> In March 2009, this mail forum was renamed `es5-discuss`.
* <a id="81">[81]</a> Other code that receives `arguments` objects may come from unknown sources and should not be trusted.
* <a id="82">[82]</a> The so-called "static object function" is also called "static object method". There is a conceptual difference between objects used as namespaces and objects used as behavioral abstractions. This distinction is not reflected in the actual semantics of the language. Some JavaScript programmers use the word "method" to make this distinction, others do not.
* <a id="83">[83]</a> The so-called "reuse" means that the design of each feature should use a common set of concepts and syntax elements.
* <a id="84">[84]</a> Wirfs-Brock's proposal is no longer available directly, but is included in Miller [[2008a](./references.md#msm:defineProp)]'s reply , which has embedded much of the text in the proposal.
* <a id="85">[85]</a> The term "configurable" was coined by Neil Mix [[2008a](./references.md#mix:21aug08)].
* <a id="86">[86]</a> Pratap Lakshman contributed to this section.
* <a id="87">[87]</a> Herman cannot remember where he encountered the idea. But it's probably related to the "champion model" used by Oscar Nierstrasz [[2000](./references.md#nierstrasz2000identify)] for organizing project committees.
* <a id="88">[88]</a> These "dream" labels and descriptions are paraphrased from Brendan Eich's blog post. The "dream" code snippets are direct quotes from the original text. Notice that he chose a semicolon-free style when writing his "dream" code.
* <a id="89">[89]</a> Basic traps are primitive, and the default behavior of derived traps is defined by the basic trap.
* <a id="90">[90]</a> User-defined internal methods are not supported in ES5, so there is no need to explicitly enforce these consistency rules.
* <a id="91">[91]</a> One design concern is the cost of enforcing consistency rules after each Proxy's trap. Notification Proxies [[Van Cutsem 2013](./references.md#notificationproxies)] This alternative design can be roughly considered as a way to eliminate this overhead.
* <a id="92">[92]</a> So-called "high integrity objects" support impenetrable information hiding. Outside the code segment that defines such an object, its structure, inheritance relationships, encapsulated state, and methods cannot be directly modified or extended.
* <a id="93">[93]</a> Typical conventions include non-enumerability of methods and the use of read-only attributes.
* <a id="94">[94]</a> Prior to ES6, clause 15 of the specification was the part that defined built-in objects and classes.
* <a id="95">[95]</a> Russell Leggett used the metaphor of "safe school", that is, a prospective college student will apply for "safe school" if he is not admitted to any school of his choice. School" as a backup.
* <a id="96">[96]</a> The constructor method was eventually added back into the design in the form of the `static` keyword.
* <a id="97">[97]</a> CommonJS modules usually export a single object and use it as a namespace.
* <a id="98">[98]</a> Mozilla's implementation is based on a new ES4 proposal [[TC39 ES4 2006c](./references.md#es4:expressionclosures)].
* <a id="99">[99]</a> Tennent's consistency principle holds that in a function, if a piece of code is moved to another function and the function is called immediately, it should produce the same result as the direct execution The same effect as the original code snippet.
* <a id="100">[100]</a> The stack-destroying tail call has proven to be a controversial feature. It has been successfully implemented by at least one major browser engine, but others refuse to support it.
